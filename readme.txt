So, I bulid this game when I completed JavaScript lecture series. I have used basic HTML syntax. In style CSS I havent as such focused on styling, I had styled it
very basic. Major logic was in app.js. I have used the concepts which I studied theoretically in JS lectures such as arays, DOM manipulation, eventListeners, enable/disable 
etc... These are things which looks like I am doing really basic things but, I think this will increase my strength in core of programming. To be able to do this things easily 
gives me power to go and build better and better applications, in which concepts used are core concepts mostly, but the way we use these concepts to solve complex problems/
complex logics, thats actual thing helpful in journey to become a good programmer. 





One more added problem (Solution in link)
https://github.com/shradha-khapra/JavaScriptSeries/tree/main/TicTacToe

Implement the logic for "Draw" condition. You have to track when the game has no winner.
In this case, print a different message in the msg <p>.

Hint - Use a new variable, count, which counts button clicks. When the total count reaches 9,
but game has no winners, that means the game was a Draw.
